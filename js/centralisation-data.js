    summary: "The Indian Express reported that Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi objected in writing at least 14 times in 10 months. They said decisions on voter registration, deletions, appeals and roll security were taken without their knowledge. They cited the 2023 Act and Article 324, under which the Commission acts as a body of three. The ECI called the notes part of normal deliberation and said its decisions were unanimous. On 26 September 2026 it promised agendas in advance and minutes afterwards. On 5 October the Supreme Court refused to suspend CEC Gyanesh Kumar, but asked for a response on whether he acted unilaterally.",

    summary: "Under the law, each constituency's Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) decides who goes on the roll. Sandhu and Joshi warned of a 'gradual centralisation' of the roll database in the ECI's IT division in Delhi. They also wrote to the Cabinet Secretary after supervision of the digital systems was reassigned. In Goa, eligible voters stayed off the roll because the ECINet software would not let officials reverse decisions. Maharashtra's chief electoral officer asked for the software to be changed so EROs could use the discretion the law gives them. The ECI later ordered a review of ECINet.",
