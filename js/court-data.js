    summary: "The challenge to the law that dropped the Chief Justice from the selection panel was filed soon after it passed. In March 2024 the Court declined to stay the appointments made under it. In February 2025 the pleas were mentioned twice but not heard, the same week the government named a new CEC under the same law. In July 2026 the Court reserved its decision on whether to send the case to a larger bench. In September 2026 the two judges split, and it went to the Chief Justice. Meanwhile three commissioners have been appointed under the law being challenged.",
