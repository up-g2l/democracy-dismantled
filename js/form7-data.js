    summary: "About 6,000 Form 7 applications were filed online before the 2023 poll to delete Aland voters, by impersonating other voters. A police SIT says they were filed through login IDs made with bought mobile numbers and OTPs, at about Rs 80 per application. In December 2025 its chargesheet named former BJP MLA Subhash Guttedar and his son as the main accused; they deny it. The Election Commission called Rahul Gandhi's charges 'incorrect and baseless'. It said the deletion attempts had failed, that it had itself filed an FIR, and that no member of the public can delete a vote online.",
